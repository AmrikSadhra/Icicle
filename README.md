# Icicle

Read and write Clarion RCL skin packages, used in Xanavi media center firmware. 
These units are used in vehicles such as the Nissan GTR, 370z, Infiniti G37, along with many more.

## Planned Features

* Repack your own RCLs in order to enable custom themes for Xanavi firmware

## Usage

Currently only unpacking is supported, hence we only take an output directory.

```bash
./icicle [path_to_rcl_file] [output_directory]
```
